# Phantom ECU Steganographic Attack

## Overview
Novel steganographic CAN bus attack development using real car hacking dataset baselines. This attack attempts to evade detection by mimicking legitimate ECU behavior while injecting malicious payloads through sophisticated bit manipulation techniques.

## Research Question
Can steganographic CAN bus attacks using real normal traffic baselines achieve better evasion than existing attack vectors?

## Key Finding
**HYPOTHESIS REJECTED**: Real car data baselines made attacks MORE detectable (F1: 0.825) compared to simulated baselines (F1: 0.763), representing a +6.2% increase in detection accuracy.

## Technical Implementation

### Steganographic Techniques
1. **LSB Manipulation**: Flips 1-3 least significant bits for data injection
2. **Bit Rotation**: Maintains bit counts while changing patterns
3. **Entropy Preservation**: Maintains 85% of original Shannon entropy
4. **Pattern Injection**: Progressive escalation with position-based patterns
5. **Adaptive Timing**: ±2% timing variance to avoid detection patterns

### Target Selection
- **CAN IDs**: 0002, 0130, 0131, 0140, 0316, 0350, 043F, 0545
- **Contamination**: 12% target → 7% actual injection rate
- **Escalation**: Attack intensity increases 1.15x over time
